# WebMiner API
(not really and API)

WebMiner API is a set of sites/scripts that I wrote to mine monero. Written around the infamous coinminer API.

  - Descrete user optin - optout page
  - Indescrete miner, logs to browser console
  - Magic

# New Features!

  - You can specify which key you would like to load
  - View hashrate on both types (indescrete and descrete)
  - View other stats e.g. mined and accepted hashes.


# Comming Up:
  - User list table a.k.a contributor HOF (total mined hashes)
  - choose how many threads you would like to use (currently using all avaliable if your using chrome)
  - web server integration 
  - decent formatting :D
